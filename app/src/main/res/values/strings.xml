    <string name="app_description">Share-i app is a WiFi Peer-to-Peer application which helps to share a photo among connected android devices. Wi-Fi Direct (P2P) allows devices with the appropriate hardware to connect directly to each other via Wi-Fi without an intermediate access point. Using these APIs, we can discover and connect to other devices when each device supports Wi-Fi P2P, then communicate over a speedy connection across distances much longer than a Bluetooth connection. <br></br><br></br><b>\n\nObjectives:</b><br></br>\n1. Help transfer an image from one mobile device to another. In this android app, image from one device can be shared to the other device who is receiving by establishing a connection over a WiFi and the receiver can get the image shared.
        <br></br><br></br>\n\n2. Help nearby devices to easily transfer an image without internet connection.
    The application will be using a WiFi communication range to connect the nearby mobiles
    present within the operating range.<br></br><br></br>\n\n <b>Email: </b>be-gain.gcit@rub.edu.bt</string>
